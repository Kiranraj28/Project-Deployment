# --- CORE APPLICATION & WEB UI ---
streamlit
# Used for data manipulation (often needed even if just for processing prediction outputs)
pandas
# Used for data manipulation, especially by scikit-learn
numpy

# --- DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS ---
# TensorFlow is the primary engine for Keras models (your *.keras file)
# Use 'tensorflow' instead of 'tensorflow-cpu' for general cloud deployment
# The cloud environment will typically use the standard package.
tensorflow

# Keras is part of TensorFlow now, but including it explicitly can prevent 'ModuleNotFoundError'
keras

# Used for loading models saved in the HDF5 format (*.h5 or the underlying format of *.keras)
h5py 

# --- IMAGE & ML UTILITIES ---
# Essential for image handling (uploading, resizing, converting to array)
pillow
# If you use scikit-learn for any pre/post-processing (metrics, encoders, train/test split)
scikit-learn
# If your model saves/loads objects using joblib (e.g., class labels, scalers)
joblib
# Used for plotting charts, like model performance or prediction results
matplotlib
