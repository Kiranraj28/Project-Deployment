**üåæRice Leaf Disease Classification**

This project leverages deep learning to automate the identification of common rice leaf diseases from images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network with MobileNetV2 as backbone and custom classification layers, the model distinguishes between Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut.

**Key Features:**
- **Robust deep learning architecture:** Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 provides strong generalization on small agricultural datasets.
- **Real-time image analysis:** Upload rice leaf images and receive instant disease predictions with confidence scores.
- **Data augmentation:** Comprehensive techniques (flips, rotations, zooms, contrast adjustments) increase model resilience to varied field conditions.
- **Practical application:** Accelerates disease detection for researchers and farmers, helping minimize crop loss and enhance food security.

**Results:**
Achieves high accuracy in classifying major rice leaf diseases, demonstrating AI‚Äôs value in precision agriculture and plant pathology.

st.sidebar.markdown("""
**Understanding Confidence Score**
The confidence score expresses how certain the model is about its prediction, ranging from 0 (no certainty) to 1 (maximum certainty).
- Values closer to 1 indicate the prediction is highly reliable.
- Moderate values (e.g., around 0.5-0.7) suggest more uncertainty or similarity between categories.
- The confidence score helps guide user trust and follow-up decisions when reviewing results.
